We are looking for a developer/team to build a Pump.fun-style Meme Token Launchpad on the X Layer chain (OKX zkEVM L2).

Key Features:

Token Creation – Users can mint a new token instantly by paying a small fee in OKB.
Bonding Curve Model – Automatic pricing and liquidity accumulation through bonding curve mechanics.
OKB Pool Mechanism – Fees collected in OKB are pooled. Once 80 OKB is accumulated, it will be transferred to DEX liquidity. Out of this, 36 OKB will be permanently locked to secure the base liquidity.
DEX Integration – After the threshold is met, liquidity will be automatically added to a DEX on X Layer (e.g., OkieSwap/Uniswap v2/v3).
Fee Distribution – A portion of transaction/creation fees will be distributed between the platform, token creators, and referrers.
Frontend UI – A clean, user-friendly website with wallet integration (OKX Wallet / MetaMask).
Deliverables:

Smart contracts (Solidity, EVM-compatible)
Frontend (React/Next.js preferred)
Deployment scripts + documentation
Testnet demo before mainnet launch
Payment Terms:

Milestone 1: Smart contract framework + testnet deployment (20%)
Milestone 2: Frontend + wallet integration (30%)
Milestone 3: Full functionality test + DEX integration (30%)
Milestone 4: Mainnet launch + documentation (20%)
